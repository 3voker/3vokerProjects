PizzaBase, Hi. 
Look I know I probably 
shouldn't come back.
The last time I was there 
the food wasn't that good
and the server stuttered so
much asking for our orders. 
It was just embarrasing to see. 
So to avoid that inconvienence 
Do you deliver?

Great. 
I'll order one mighty cuck. 
Gentrified bread block.
And...
....
I'm not sure...
Oh...
Do you still offer those um...
Social Justice Canniballs?
Right. I'll take that too.
Okay.  
I'll be waiting by the 
window. Be quick, I need to 
pick my kids up from school 
soon. 
Thanks!
