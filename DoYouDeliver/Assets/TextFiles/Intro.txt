Congratulations player!
You were hired for a small town pizza job! 
Its a better gig than most people are doing!
Your boss is so nice and humble and seems trusting.
Such a shame you lied during the interview.
"What's a Dewey?", xe asked. 
To which you replied.
"Oh uh, that's my middle name, yup...Dewey."
You can call it a miscommunication when xe founds out. 
But now you have pizza's to deliver with no license to drive.
So with bills and a cat named Walker to take care of. 
A struggling business owner who trusts you.
And your own lying selfish self to feed. 
Do you choose to fail them and yourself or...
